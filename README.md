# simple_navigation_goals
This project is made to control a turtlebot3 Burger using python code.
The first purpose is just to control the remote function.

The next step is to update the code to respect a part of the robocup @home.

How to use the code :
- clone the python file
- launch a gazebo sim or a rviz to have a turtlebot robot
- run the python file using the command --> python simple_navigation_goals
